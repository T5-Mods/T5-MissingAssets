# T5-MissingAssets
All of the major/minor assets missing from the Black Ops Mod Tools, and some assets fixed.

The Black Ops Mod Tools first came out at around 2011, between the release dates of the Annihilation and Rezurrection Packs. Unfortunately, it didn't include most of the assets that were in said packs, only including some of the assets seen on First Strike.

# The Purpose of the Pack
This pack is made to complete everything that the Black Ops Mod Tools has lacked. Accompanied by utilizing [LinkerMod](https://github.com/Nukem9/LinkerMod) or [LinkerMod Enhanced](https://github.com/ribbitpoison/LinkerMod-Enhanced), this pack can pack a serious punch for everyone to use the complete assets, as they were intended with the original Mod Tools.

# Installation (Manual)
Download the [source code ZIP file on this page](https://github.com/ribbitpoison/T5-MissingAssets). Then, you insert every file to your main Black Ops Directory.

# Installation (Automatic)
Now with [Mythical's Black Ops Mod Tools Installer](https://github.com/Mythical-Github/Black-Ops-Mod-Tools-Installer), you can have T5-MissingAssets bundled in!
